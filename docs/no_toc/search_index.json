The intention of this guide is to provide instructors more information about how to make the most of our case studies. 1.2 Target Audience This guide is intended for educators who are interested in using Open Case Studies for instruction. Elements of the case studies can be helpful for instructors who teach: High school students Undergraduate students Graduate students Elements of the case studies can assist with teaching courses about the following topics: Data science Statistics Public health Programming Technical writing … and more 1.3 Curriculum This guide documents: The Open Case Studies philosophy The general structure of case studies Various entry points to using the case studies (including an R package to enable modular use of the case studies) Examples of how to use the case studies How to modify and adapt components of the case studies for the classroom How to contribute new case studies. 1.4 Open Case Studies Philosophy 1.5 Open Case Studies Anatomy Case studies are designed to be self-contained examples of complete data analyses. They start with a subject area of interest and a problem definition. Each case study is composed of three main stages:   Stage 1: Getting Started   In the first stage, students learn about the subject area they will be investigating in their data analysis. This can include historical perspectives, previous literature, and current overarching questions in the field. Ideally, this will provide motivation as to why the data analysis they will be performing is interesting and useful. Students will then further refine questions of interest and define a specific question to be investigated by the data at hand. This question will define the statistical and data science learning objectives for the case study. Finally, students will explore the limitations of their investigation and discuss why their data analysis may or may not be able to fully answer the main question of interest. - Case study context - Study motivation - Main question - Learning objectives - Study limitations Stage 2: Analyzing the Data   This stage includes the bulk of the data analysis. It begins with a detailed description of the data used in the case study, how it was generated, and where is was obtained. This sets the stage for a walk-through of the data import procedure and exploration of the available data. From there, the specific subsets of the data relevant to answering the main question of interest can be identified and the data can be cleaned and wrangled to give the data in the required format. The cleaned data can then be visualized and analyzed to answer the study question. - Data description - Import and exploration - Wrangling - Visualization - Analysis Stage 3: Wrapping-Up   In the final stage of the case study, students synthesize conclusions to the main study question based on the results of their data analysis. They summarize the data exploration and analysis steps they took and discuss potential next steps they could take based on their results. Finally, additional analyses are suggested as homework and additional information relevant to the case study is provided. - Analysis conclusions - Case study summary - Next steps - Homework This anatomy is reflected in the table of contents of case study sections: Case Study Section Description Motivation Motivating figure and text at the start of the case study Main questions Scientific question(s) Learning objectives Both data science and statistics learning objectives Context Context of question(s) or data Limitations Any limitations in case study or with data used What are the data? Summary of where the data came from and what the data contain Data import Analyses for importing data Data wrangling Analyses for wrangling data Data exploration Analyses for data exploration Data visualization Analyses for data visualization Data analysis Analyses containing statistical concepts and methods to answer question(s) Summary Summary of results and conclusion Suggested homework Question(s) to explore further Additional information Helpful links and packages used The table of contents can be used to navigate to specific sections in a case study: 1.6 Starter Kit Open Case Studies are designed to be beginner friendly. Users can work through an entire case study with no prerequisite knowledge in programming, public health, or statistics. However, the appropriate technology, software, and a basic familiarity with R Studio is required. This section will detail what students will need to be able to jump into a case study. 1.6.1 Technical Requirements (avocado note from slack: what physical resources are needed - software installed - what type of computers - think about interactive case studies) All case studies use the R statistical programming language for data analysis. R is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux and can be downloaded from the The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). While there is no specific R version requirement for the case studies, the OCSdata package, which can be used to download the data, requires R version 3.5 or higher. Furthermore, R packages used to run specific analyses in each case study may have their own R version requirements. R version requirements may be checked in the Session Info section in each case study. Cheat sheets detailing how to use common packages and functions are available at the RStudio website. 1.6.2 RStudio To work with R, we recommend the RStudio Integrated Development Environment. RStudio includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or in a browser connected to RStudio Server. More information and program installation instruction are available at the RStudio website. For reproducible data analyses and easy publishing of reports and presentations, we recommend using RMarkdown. More information about RMarkdown is also available at the RStudio website. 1.6.3 GitHub Open Case Studies is hosted on GitHub. While GitHub is not needed for users to access the case studies, users can use GitHub to streamline download and modification of case studies. Check out the GitHub Organization and OCSdata sections in Chapter 2 for more details on how to use GitHub to access case studies and modify content for personalized use. An introduction on how to get started with GitHub is available at Happy Git. 1.7 Feedback We are continually working to improve the Open Case Studies project to address learner and educator needs. Feedback is essential for this goal. If you use Open Case Studies material, we would love to hear from you! Please submit your feedback in the user experience survey. We appreciate feedback about all aspects of the Open Case Studies user experience including but not limited to technical challenges, potential improvements, or new ideas on how to use the case studies in the classroom. 1.8 Contact Us [Email:] opencasestudies@gmail.com Twitter: "],["open-case-study-infrastructure.html", "Chapter 2 Open Case Study Infrastructure 2.1 Learning Objectives 2.2 OCS Website 2.3 OCS Case Study Search Tool 2.4 Open Case Studies GitHub Organization 2.5 OCSdata", " Chapter 2 Open Case Study Infrastructure 2.1 Learning Objectives In this chapter we will discuss the overall infrastructure of the Open Case Studies platform, which includes: * our website * an open case studies search tool * our GitHub organization * an R package called OCSdata 2.2 OCS Website Links to all of our case studies can be found on the Open Case Studies website at opencasestudies.org. The case studies are listed in a searchable table that will be detailed further in the following section. A description of the Open Case Studies’ mission, history, and people can be found on the website as well as an archive of talks and blog posts. 2.2.1 Open Case Studies mission The OpenCaseStudies website describes the mission of the OpenCaseStudies project, the history of its inception, and current and previous members of the OCS team, among other information. The website also includes a link to a user experience survey (takes up to 10 minutes to complete), which helps us learn more about how to improve the data science education experience. Part of this includes getting a better understanding of who is using our case studies and how so that we can better design our case studies. We would greatly appreciate you filling it out if you have the time! Finally, the website includes the OCS case study search tool to aid instructors in finding appropriate case studies for their learning objectives. The search tool is described in more detail below. 2.3 OCS Case Study Search Tool This diagram illustrates the workflow of accessing a case study from the OCS website through the case study search table. From the table, users can use the provided links to view the original static case studies, interactive case studies, and the GitHub repositories for each. Users may find all case study source files in the case study repository as well as instructions on how to use the case study. The Open Case Study Search tool can be found at the bottom of the OCS Website. The tool consists of a table with searchable columns and each row describing an individual case study. This searchable table is designed to aid instructors in identifying appropriate case studies for their learning objectives. The columns are organized as such: The “Case Study” column contains the case study name and a link to the static and interactive versions of the case study (if available) The “GitHub Repository” column provides links to the case study’s associated GitHub repository that contains all case study source files, data, code, and more The “Packages” column details all the R packages used in the case study, and can help identify if a case study teaches a specific data import, wrangling, analysis, or visualization skill The “Objectives” column details the learning objectives of each case study (e.g. importing data from PDF files, reshaping data, specific statistical analysis, etc.) The “Category” column lists the source of funding or project that the case study is associated with The main two columns likely to be helpful in identifying appropriate case studies are the “Packages” and “Objectives” columns. The “Packages” column details all the R packages used in the case study, and can help identify if a case study teaches a specific data import, wrangling, analysis, or visualization skill. The “Objectives” column details the learning objectives of each case study (e.g. importing data from PDF files, reshaping data, specific statistical analysis, etc.). The overall search bar allows users to search with keywords across all columns, otherwise users can search individual columns of interest. This table can be used to access all case study resources: 2.4 Open Case Studies GitHub Organization GitHub is a website and cloud service that enables developers to store, manage, and track changes to their code. OCS uses GitHub for both development and distribution purposes. Users have complete access to all case study material through our OCS GitHub page where each case study is hosted in an individual repository. The repository contains all the materials needed for the case study. This includes the case study text to be distributed to students, the data used in the case study (discussed below), additional documents and references, and brief guidelines on case study use. Data included in the GitHub repository is available in multiple formats to enable modular use of the case studies. This diagram explains the case study data folder structure and how data is categorized into different sub-folders: Data included in the GitHub repository is available in multiple formats to facilitate modularization of the case studies as described below. To use the case study data, you can download the GitHub repository directly or use the OCSdata R package described below. 2.5 OCSdata To simplify the process of accessing the data required for each case study, we have created the OCSdata R package. Briefly, the OCSdata package creates a new folder called “OCSdata” where it downloads the data needed for a specific case study. Users can download the data in its original raw format or in various processed formats that correspond to different stages of data wrangling and cleaning. This allows users to perform the data exploration and wrangling or the data visualization and analysis sections of the case study without having to process the data from the raw files. For some of the case studies, the OCSdata package also downloads extra source data that is not used in the case study. (Add table 2.1 summarizing data formats available for download via OCSdata) 2.5.1 Getting Started with OCSdata The OCSdata package is available on the package repository CRAN and can be installed in R as follows: [avocado R version requirement?] install.packages(&quot;OCSdata&quot;) #only run once to install package library(OCSdata) #run every new R session to load package 2.5.2 Downloading raw data The raw_data function will download the raw data files that can be imported into R. The first argument is the name of the case study. A list of case study names can be found in the package documentation online or by typing ?raw_data in R. The outpath argument is a string specifying the folder where the data should be downloaded. To download the data to a folder named “OCS_data” in the current working directory, you can supply getwd() to the output argument. If nothing is provided for the argument, you will be prompted to enter 1, 2, or 3 to download the data into the current director, to specify the download path, or to cancel, respectively. In the following example, we download the raw data for the “Opioids in the United States” case study to the current directory. raw_data(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) 2.5.3 Downloading data in other formats The OCSdata package can be used to download the data in various processed formats that may be helpful in skipping certain case study sections and focusing on data wrangling and/or analysis and visualization. All of the functions take the same arguments described above. 2.5.3.1 Simpler import The simpler_import_data function will download raw data files that have been converted to file formats that are easier to import into R, typically .csv. Some case studies offer this option when the original raw files require a more complicated import step. simpler_import_data(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) 2.5.3.2 Importing data as R objects The imported_data function will download raw data files in .rda format. This means the data have already been imported into R objects. This can be used to skip the data import section and start directly with data wrangling. The R objects files can be imported into R by either double clicking on the files in Rstudio or using the load() function as follows. imported_data(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) #download data in .rda format file_path = &quot;~/OCS_data/data/imported/land_area.rda&quot; #specify download directory load(file_path) #load R objects 2.5.3.3 Importing wrangled data The following functions will download the data files that have already been wrangled and are ready to be analyzed. These come in both .csv and .rda formats. Download as csv files: wrangled_csv(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) Downloading as R objects: wrangled_rda(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) 2.5.4 Downloading extra data Some case studies have extra data are not used in the case study but can be used to explore the case study subject from different perspectives. These data but can This data can be downloaded using the extra_data function. extra_data(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) 2.5.5 Downloading all case study data The zip_ocs function will download the all of the repository files in a .zip folder and unzip them into a specified directory. This includes the case study data in all the formats detailed above (raw, simpler_import, imported, wrangled, and extra). It also includes the case study .Rmd file, which can be modified by instructors as needed. zip_ocs(&quot;ocs-bp-opioid-rural-urban&quot;, outpath = getwd()) 2.5.6 Forking the case study repository ## R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS/LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.8.so ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=C ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] bookdown_0.24 digest_0.6.25 crayon_1.3.4 R6_2.4.1 ## [5] lifecycle_1.0.0 magrittr_2.0.2 evaluate_0.14 highr_0.8 ## [9] pillar_1.4.6 stringi_1.5.3 rlang_0.4.10 fs_1.5.0 ## [13] jquerylib_0.1.4 vctrs_0.3.4 ellipsis_0.3.1 rmarkdown_2.10 ## [17] tools_4.0.2 stringr_1.4.0 readr_1.4.0 hms_0.5.3 ## [21] yaml_2.2.1 xfun_0.26 compiler_4.0.2 pkgconfig_2.0.3 ## [25] htmltools_0.5.0 ottrpal_0.1.2 knitr_1.33 tibble_3.0.3 "],["use-of-open-case-studies.html", "Chapter 3 Use of Open Case Studies 3.1 Learning Objectives 3.2 Open Case Studies in the Classroom 3.3 Case Study Recommendations 3.4 Example Use Cases 3.5 Examples of assignments", " Chapter 3 Use of Open Case Studies 3.1 Learning Objectives This chapter will provide guidance on how to use Open Case Studies in classroom settings. We will give a coarse guide on which case studies include material appropriate for beginner, intermediate, or advanced learners. We will present some examples of assignments that can accompany the case studies and the rubrics that they can be evaluated with. Furthermore, we provide examples of extensions to case studies that can serve as a template for homework assignments or independent student exploration. The examples presented in this chapter are merely suggestions - modifications to the case studies to fit student needs are expected and encouraged! If you come up with a different way to use the case studies, please let us know what you come up with so that other educators may be inspired by your creativity. 3.1.1 Prerequisites Public Health Subject Matter The case studies in Open Case Studies generally deal with topics in public health. We do not require any prior knowledge on the public health subjects examined in the case studies. The Getting Started section in each case study (specifically, the case study context) will present the subject material relevant to understanding the data and the case study implications. Statistics The case studies cover a range of statistical approaches and skillsets. Some case studies will build on more foundational statistical concepts. The Experience Level categorization for each case study (see Section 3.3) will indicate the expected prior skills that the case study will expect. Furthermore, the exact skills that the case study will use are listed in the Case Study Search Tool under the Objectives column. Coding/Data Science All case studies use the R statistical programming language for data analysis. Some familiarity with R basics is expected for effective use of the case studies. However, depending on the data used and the extent to which it needs to be cleaned and processed before analysis, each case study may require experience with additional programming and data wrangling skills. This will be indicated by the Experience Level designation for the case study (see Section 3.3). Software All case studies use the R statistical programming language for data analysis. While there is no specific R version requirement for the case studies, the OCSdata package, which can be used to get and load the data, does require R 3.5 (avocado). Furthermore, R packages used to run specific analyses in each case study may have their own R version requirements. R version requirements may be checked in the sessionInfo() section in each case study. 3.1.2 Experience Level Descriptions 3.1.3 Experience Level Descriptions The table below explains how we define the beginner, intermediate, and advanced experience levels. Experience Level Description Beginner Little to no previous experience with coding and/or statistical analysis. Intermediate Familiar with at least one programming language and has experience working with data and statistics. Advanced Fluent in at least one programming language and likely familiar with more. Has a depth of experience working with data science projects. Typically, most middle/high school and first year undergraduate students will fit in the beginner category. Upperclassmen undergraduates and some graduate students are often at the intermediate level. Most advanced level students will be at the graduate level. However, this is a generalization, and a student may be considered beginner, intermediate, or advanced at any academic level depending on their independent studies and experiences. 3.2 Open Case Studies in the Classroom The case studies are structured to support both partial and full use of a case study. Educators are also free to use case study data by itself. 3.2.1 Teaching a Full Case Study The case studies are written to provide a cohesive story that simulates data science in the real world. Reading through an entire case study is an excellent exercise for students to experience a standard data science workflow and learn the best practices of today from start to finish. The following list provides a few examples of how educators have used a full case study in the past: Converted the case study into a slide deck (add link, source and example image of slide) Assigned students to read the case study and write a report as homework Suggested reading and supplemental material more? (avocado add discussion of interactive case studies) 3.2.2 Teaching Part of a Case Study Some educators may find that only certain sections of a case study are relevant to their course learning objectives. For these educators the case studies are structured to allow for modular use. The case study GitHub repositories provide the appropriate data files to be used at the start of each section. These data files can be downloaded directly from GitHub or with the OCSdata package (see chapter 2.5). The following table describes which data folder contains the corresponding data for each case study section. An example use for each data type is provided as well.

Influence of Multicollinearity on Measured Impact of Right-to-Carry Gun Laws Part 2: Static, Interactive. 3.4 Example Use Cases Because the case studies were developed to be modular and stand-alone, they can be used in a variety of ways that cater to the learner’s goals, experience, and interests. Below, we provide a few examples of how case studies have been used previously. If you use Open Case Studies in a new way, we would love to hear about it! Beginner Undergraduate Data Science Course Practical Data Science in R is a 10-week intermediate undergraduate course taught be Dr. Shannon Ellis at University of California Santa Barbara. It includes three Open Case Studies and uses them to illustrate how foundational data science skills and statistical concepts taught throughout the course can be applied to real data. The course incorporates labs and homeworks, which have guided coding and analysis exercises related to the concepts discussed in lecture. The course also assigns written reports where students present the analysis they conduct related to the case study in the format of a scientific article (see example assignment below). Advanced Graduate Data Science Course Advanced Data Science is a semester-long course taught by Dr. Jeff Leek and Dr. Roger Peng in 2020 at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, primarily for PhD students. This course is designed for students to gain experience in designing and communicating data analyses effectively and critically analyzing analyses. Assignments included writing scientific journal sections (e.g. Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) based on the case studies and extending analyses based on results presented in the case study. Independent Study Case studies can be used for learners to gain experience in statistics and data science independently. We strongly recommend that independent learners aim to actively engage with the case study by running the analyses independently, exploring the data beyond what is presented in the case study, and extending the analyses by to investigate their own hypotheses. Furthermore, creating a finished product, such as a blog post or a presentation, can be an excellent demonstration of the skills learned. Interactive Case Studies Some of the case studies are also included in interactive versions. These versions allow students to write and run code in the browser interactively, with hints and answers available for students to check their progress as they go through the case study. Interactive case studies could be appropriate for independent learning or for in class labs, as they provide real time feedback and can reduce demands on the educator to provide intensive personalized feedback. 3.5 Examples of assignments Educators are not limited to having the students go through the case study in their current format. Case studies can be a spring board for further exploration and additional assignments. For example, in addition to helping students develop data analysis skills, we hope that the case studies can also help students develop their curiosity, technical writing and communication skills. Additional assignments can include but is not limited to data visualization and presentation, written reports, and oral presentations. Below we provide a few examples of potential assignments that educators can use to tailor instruction to the desired learning objectives. Further Exploration Several case studies have additional data that is not discussed. This can be used for further exploration of the subject area that was discussed in the case study. This can be guided by the questions included in the Homework section of the case studies. Case studies that have additional data include the Opioid Use Case Study, the Right to Carry Case Study, and the CO2 Emissions Case Study. Written Report Below is an example of a scientific-style paper written based on the Opioid Use Case Study. We also include an example rubric by which this paper can be evaluated adapted from here. OCS Example Report Assignment Guide OCS Opioid Use in the US Example Report OCS Opioid Use in the US Example Report Rubric Oral Presentation Below is an example of a presentation based on the Vaping Behaviors in American Youth Case Study. This presentation focuses on the context of the study and the methods used in the analysis. Assignments for presentations can be modified to emphasize presenting results and conclusions or to emphasize communication to different audiences (e.g. policy makers, other researchers, the public, etc. ). (avocado insert presentation assignment guide, example, and grading rubric) Data Visualization The data visualizations included in the case studies are not the only way to present the results of the analyses. While the principles of effective data visualization are not a focus of the case studies, the data included as well as the study questions can be used to guide students through the design choices that are commonly considered when determining how to best present data. As examples, we link a lecture on the principles of data visualization from Dr. Peter Aldhous’ Introduction to Data Visualization Course and a data visualization assignment and accompanying grading rubric from the Interactive Data Visualization course at MIT’s Department of Computer Science.

For example, a statistics teacher may want students to practice the skills covered in the data analysis section, but doesn’t have time to go through the whole case study. The case studies are designed to allow for such use. This educator and their students may jump right in to any case study section without working through any previous sections. This is made possible because the data files are saved at the end of each section. These data files are made available on the case study’s GitHub repository and may also be downloaded with the help of the OCSdata package.

You may also be downloaded wrangled data in .CSV format by replacing ‘wrangled_rda’ with ‘wrangled_csv’ 2.1.3) Load the RDA files with the following commands: load(file = here::here(&quot;OCS_data&quot;, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;wrangled&quot;, &quot;Annual_opioid_data.rda&quot;)) load(file = here::here(&quot;OCS_data&quot;, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;wrangled&quot;, &quot;county_info.rda&quot;)) 2.2) Manually Download from GitHub: 2.2.1) Download the .RDA files available on the case study GitHub repository from here The CSV versions of the files may also be downloaded here, if preferred 2.2.2) Move the data files from your ‘Downloads’ folder to your R session’s current working directory (you can see what this is with getwd()). 2.2.3) Load the RDA files with the following commands: load(file = here::here(&quot;Annual_opioid_data.rda&quot;)) load(file = here::here(&quot;county_info.rda&quot;)) All the data you need to work through the current section is now loaded into your environment. You are ready to work through the section of interest, without needing to work through any of the previous sections. 4.3 Modify a case study The case studies are written in R Markdown documents and developed within an RStudio project. R Markdown documents are denoted with the file extension “.Rmd” and allow for the inclusion of code chunks and outputs in a written report. They are written using Markdown syntax (avocado$). RStudio projects are used to organize the case studies and support version control (is this correct?). The knitr package “knits” the case study written in R Markdown and outputs the document as an HTML file. Open Case Studies uses these HTML files to post the case studies online. The entire case study project is contained in a GitHub repository which allows for easy distribution and version control. GitHub Pages is used to host the case study webpage from the case study repository. $ do we have any resources for markdown we prefer to use? Modifying a case study requires the following simple steps: Clone or fork the case study repository from GitHub. Clone if you only want to have the repository locally. Fork if you would like to have both a local version and a remote repository on your personal GitHub account. In the repository folder, open the case study .Rproj file to open the project up in RStudio. Edit the sections to be modified in the index.Rmd file. Save your changes, then click on the “Knit” drop down menu in the top left corner of RStudio. Choose which file format you’d like to knit to. Distribute your modified case study as you please! (avocado should i add a note here about hosting online with personal GitHub pages?) *add reference to a resource on GitHub for beginners? *create a video showing: step by step example of forking a case study repository, editing Rmd content, knitting, and sharing the output 4.4 Create a case study Open Case Studies offers two options for creating a case study. The first method is a template repository available on GitHub. The second is a new live web application. The first option offers more customization, while the second is much more fast and simple. 4.4.1 Template Case Study A template case study is available in a repository on our GitHub page at github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-template. This template contains the basic skeletal structure used for our case studies. Creating a new case study with the template is very similar to modifying an existing case study: Clone the template at opencasestudies/ocs-bp-template. (avocado should be “click use as template button”) Open the index.Rmd file in RStudio. Add the case study content to the index.Rmd file. Use the instructions provided in this file to add different elements such as images and videos. Save your changes and knit the case study to the preferred file format. Distribute the knitted case study as you please! *avocado create a video showing step by step example of creating case study with template 4.4.2 MakeCaseStudies App Open Case Studies now also offers the MakeCaseStudies app as an option for our users to create their own case studies. The app has an easy-to-use interface where users can copy and paste their content into text boxes on the “Create” tab and check the “Preview” tab to see what they’ve made so far. Once satisfied, click the download button to export your finished case study! *avocado attach/add link to video about app from DELTA symposium 4.5 Session info ## R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS/LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.8.so ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=C ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] OCSdata_1.0.2 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] knitr_1.33 magrittr_2.0.2 usethis_2.1.5.9000 hms_0.5.3 ## [5] R6_2.4.1 rlang_0.4.10 httr_1.4.2 stringr_1.4.0 ## [9] highr_0.8 tools_4.0.2 xfun_0.26 jquerylib_0.1.4 ## [13] htmltools_0.5.0 ellipsis_0.3.1 ottrpal_0.1.2 yaml_2.2.1 ## [17] digest_0.6.25 tibble_3.0.3 lifecycle_1.0.0 crayon_1.3.4 ## [21] bookdown_0.24 purrr_0.3.4 readr_1.4.0 vctrs_0.3.4 ## [25] fs_1.5.0 glue_1.6.1 evaluate_0.14 rmarkdown_2.10 ## [29] stringi_1.5.3 compiler_4.0.2 pillar_1.4.6 pkgconfig_2.0.3 "],["new-case-studies---building-and-contributing.html", "Chapter 5 New Case Studies - Building and Contributing", " Chapter 5 New Case Studies - Building and Contributing In this chapter we will discuss the guidelines for creating new case studies as well as how to publish your own new case study as part of our project. To preserve the integrity of the core ideas of our resource we provide the following guidelines for case studies to be included in the Open Case Studies collection: 5.0.1 Guidelines: Programming language: Case studies should be written in open source programming languages (preferably R). Data: Case studies should use data that is publicly available or can be made publicly available. Please ensure that you are allowed to make the data public if it is not already. Transparent descriptions of data sources and how data was generated should be included when possible. Core sections: all case studies should include the following sections consistent with the published case studies. See Chapter 1, Case Study Anatomy for a detailed description on what each section should include: Case study context Study motivation Main question Learning objectives Study limitations Data description Import and exploration Wrangling Visualization Analysis Analysis conclusions Case study summary Next steps Homework Additional information Content: Despite often being motivated by articles, case studies are not intended to demonstrate the methods of a paper - they are intended as an educational resource where users are guided through the data science process. Links to literature or other sources to motivate the scientific topic of the case study should be included where possible. Case studies should aim to describe the decision making process involved in performing data science related tasks. Attribution: all outside resources used in the case study should be referenced appropriately. Case studies should include disclaimers and appropriate license agreements. All included images (that are not original to the case study) should include relevant sources. 5.0.2 Submission: Data: All data files should be saved in a folder named “data” within the project directory. All files should be contained in a sub-folder using the design scheme outlined in this diagram: The data folder is required to have at least raw, imported, and wrangled data files. This allows users to skip sections when convenient. The raw data folder consists of data files as they came from the source. These are used at the beginning of the case study analysis at the Data Import section. Imported data is the version of the data after it has already been imported into R. These should be in the form of R Data files (extensions include .RData, .Rda, and .Rds). To create these files, use the save() function in R after importing the raw data. Wrangled data is the version of the data after it has been cleaned and is ready for analysis. Use the save() function in R after wrangling the data to create these files. This data should be provided in both RDA and CSV format. The next two data sub-folders are optional and used as needed: If the raw data files for your case study come in a format that requires a complicated data import process (such as web scraping) you may consider providing the raw data in an import friendly format such as CSV or XLS(X). Place these files in the “simpler_import” sub-folder. If there are any raw data files from your source that are not used in the case study analysis, but could be analyzed in a similar fashion, please include these in the “extra” sub-folder. sessionInfo() ## R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS/LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.8.so ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=C ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] bookdown_0.24 digest_0.6.25 crayon_1.3.4 R6_2.4.1 ## [5] lifecycle_1.0.0 magrittr_2.0.2 evaluate_0.14 highr_0.8 ## [9] pillar_1.4.6 stringi_1.5.3 rlang_0.4.10 fs_1.5.0 ## [13] jquerylib_0.1.4 vctrs_0.3.4 ellipsis_0.3.1 rmarkdown_2.10 ## [17] tools_4.0.2 stringr_1.4.0 readr_1.4.0 hms_0.5.3 ## [21] yaml_2.2.1 xfun_0.26 compiler_4.0.2 pkgconfig_2.0.3 ## [25] htmltools_0.5.0 ottrpal_0.1.2 knitr_1.33 tibble_3.0.3 "],["about-the-authors.html", "About the Authors", " About the Authors These credits are based on our course contributors table guidelines.     Credits Names Pedagogy Lead Content Instructor(s) FirstName LastName Lecturer(s) (include chapter name/link in parentheses if only for specific chapters) -
